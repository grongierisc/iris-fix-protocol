# IRIS-fix-protocol
Implementation of the fix protocol using an IRIS python container for the initiator and a regular python container for the acceptor.

The Financial Information eXchange (FIXÂ®) Protocol has revolutionized the trading environment, proving fundamental in facilitating many of the electronic trading trends that have emerged over the past decade.

FIX has become the language of the global financial markets used extensively by buy and sell-side firms, trading platforms and even regulators to communicate trade information.

This demo has for objective to simulate a FIX client, allowing the user to create multiple sessions connected to a server ( fix acceptor ) and send buy or sell requests.

# Requirements and information
- [QuickFix](https://quickfixengine.org/c/) will be installed automatically when building ( takes 10 to 20 minutes to build once )
- If you use VSCode, you should have seen some pop up in the right corner, if you press `open in container` all the needed extensions will be installed but this step is not necessary.

See [this website](https://new.quickfixn.org/c/documentation/) for the general documentation.<br>

See [this website](https://www.onixs.biz/fix-dictionary/4.3/fields_by_tag.html#) for the tags documentation.<br>

See [this website](https://www.onixs.biz/fix-dictionary/4.3/msgs_by_msg_type.html) for the Message Types.<br>


# The demo
## Starting the demo
To start the demo you have to use docker-compose in the `iris-fix-protocol` folder:
```
docker-compose up
```

## Closing the demo
```
docker-compose down
```

## Opening the demo

If you are **NOT** inside the IRIS container connect to the demo using :
```
http://localhost:52795/csp/irisapp/EnsPortal.ProductionConfig.zen?PRODUCTION=INFORMATION.QuickFixProduction
```
The `Username` is `SuperUser` and the `Password` is `SYS`

Else, if you are inside the container :
```
http://127.0.0.1:52773/csp/irisapp/EnsPortal.ProductionConfig.zen?PRODUCTION=INFORMATION.QuickFixProduction
```
## Using the client demo : Initiator

### Settings and Sessions

**Note that** only one session can be opened by Python.Fix--- operation.

We have an **Order Session**, `Python.FixOrder` that can send to the server any message/request.

We have a **Quote Session**, `Python.FixQuote` that automatically subscribe to market data request and can send to the server any quote request.

If you want to modify the parameters of these session, click on the `Python.FixOrder` or `Python.FixQuote` then go to `settings` in the right tab, then in the `Python` part, then in the `%settings` part.
Here, you can enter or modify any parameters ( don't forget to press `apply` once your are done ).<br>
Here's the default configuration for the Fix Order:
```
BeginString=FIX.4.3
SenderCompID=CLIENTORDER
TargetCompID=SERVER
HeartBtInt=30
SocketConnectPort=3000
SocketConnectHost=acceptor
DataDictionary=/irisdev/app/src/fix/spec/FIX43.xml
FileStorePath=/irisdev/app/src/fix/Sessions/
ConnectionType=initiator
FileLogPath=./Logs/
StartTime=00:00:00
EndTime=00:00:00
ReconnectInterval=10
LogoutTimeout=5
LogonTimeout=30
ResetOnLogon=Y
ResetOnLogout=Y
ResetOnDisconnect=Y
SendRedundantResendRequests=Y
SocketNodelay=N
ValidateUserDefinedFields=N
ValidateFieldsOutOfOrder=N
```

Here's the default configuration for the Fix Quote:
```
BeginString=FIX.4.3
SenderCompID=CLIENTQUOTE
TargetCompID=SERVER
HeartBtInt=30
SocketConnectPort=3000
SocketConnectHost=acceptor
DataDictionary=/irisdev/app/src/fix/spec/FIX43.xml
FileStorePath=/irisdev/app/src/fix/Sessions/
ConnectionType=initiator
FileLogPath=./Logs/
StartTime=00:00:00
EndTime=00:00:00
ReconnectInterval=10
LogoutTimeout=5
LogonTimeout=30
ResetOnLogon=Y
ResetOnLogout=Y
ResetOnDisconnect=Y
SendRedundantResendRequests=Y
SocketNodelay=N
ValidateUserDefinedFields=N
ValidateFieldsOutOfOrder=N
symbols=EUR/USD
depth=0
```

Note that symbols represent a list of fix symbol, it should be used like this :
symbols=EUR/USD;EUR/CZK;USD/CZK

Now, on start/restart, the new configuration will apply and the new sessions will be created.


To create multiple sessions and them being active at the same time, you can add a new operation with the + near the Operation column.
In Operation Class select `Python.FixOrderOperation` or `Python.FixQuoteOperation` and in the Operation Name `Python.FixOrder2` for example, now you need to enter the configuration you want for your session.<br>
It can be the same as the default configuration seen earlier or any other valid configuration but don't forget that any new session needs to be added to the your server too.
**Note** that having two time the same session ID configuration can lead to issues concerning the connection to the server.
See this [website (in the 'Getting started' / 'Configuration' tab)](https://new.quickfixn.org/c/documentation/) for more information.

### Send a quote

You must first start the demo, using the green `Start` button or `Stop` and `Start` it again to apply your config changes.

Then, by clicking on the operation `Python.FixQuote` of your choice, and selecting in the right tab `action`, you can `test` the demo.

In this `test` window, select :<br>

**New Quote**

Type of request : `Grongier.PEX.Message`<br>

For the `classname` you must enter :
```
msg.Request
```

 And for the `json`, here is an example of quote request :
```
    {
    "header_field":
        {
            "35":"R"
        },
    "message_field":
        {
            "55": "EUR/USD",
            "40": "1"
        }
    }
```
Now you can click on `Visual Trace` to see in details what happened and see the logs of the initiator.


**Note** that for now the acceptor doesn't work with quote request and a trick is used to make it work. If your acceptor/server works with quote, you must delete from `bo.py` the lines 137 to 141 and uncomment the lines 133 to 135.

### Send an order

You must first start the demo, using the green `Start` button or `Stop` and `Start` it again to apply your config changes.

Then, by clicking on the operation `Python.FixOrder` of your choice, and selecting in the right tab `action`, you can `test` the demo.

In this `test` window, select :<br>


Here, you can send any quickfix message to the server.
Here is an example for an Order Buy request, but if you follow the same pattern almost any type of message.

**New Order Buy**
Type of request : `Grongier.PEX.Message`<br>

For the `classname` you must enter :
```
msg.Request
```

 And for the `json`, here is an example of a simple buy order :
```
    {
    "header_field":
        {
            "35":"D"
        },
    "message_field":
        {
            "55": "EUR/USD",
            "44": "100",
            "38": "10000",
            "54": "1",
            "40": "1",
            "21": "1"
        }
    }
```
Now you can click on `Visual Trace` to see in details what happened and see the logs of the initiator.

## Using the server demo : Acceptor

### Logs

The acceptor is isolated in another container, to access it's logs you must go to the source folder `iris-fix-protocol` then in the `acceptor/Logs` folder.
Here you can see the logs for each session.

### New acceptor session

If you are familiar with the FIX protocol, you now that creating a session on the client side without adding it to the server side will lead to an error, which is logical as security and reliability are key words for the FIX protocol.

To add a new session to the acceptor you must go to `acceptor/server.cfg` and add at the end of the file the sessions you wish to add.

Now you can enter in the terminal :
```sh
docker-compose up -d --build acceptor
```

**Note that this will close the acceptor and restart it so it may lead to issues regarding sent requests and stored data**
